# BakingApp
Project from Udacity as part of the Android Nanodegree

This project uses the following libraries:

ButterKnife :http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/
Timber : https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber
ExoPlayer

The application uses differents layouts depending on the device.
The App is made with MVP architechture and is done to show the interaction between differents fragments.

## Project Overview
You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

### Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

### What Will I Learn?
In this project you will:

* Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage a third-party library in your app.
* Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
* App Description
* Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

[The recipe listing is located here.](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/May/59121517_baking/baking.json)

The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images you will need to complete this project. Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.

One of the skills you will demonstrate in this project is how to handle unexpected input in your data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.
